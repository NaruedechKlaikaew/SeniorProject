Senior Project XD 07 : Study on Bottleneck Identification methodology from Traffic Big Data in Thailand
# Introduction
This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing urban traffic conditions using GPS
data collected from vehicles, which are then converted into the Traffic Performance Index
(TPI). TPI is a quantitative indicator designed to systematically reflect the level of traffic
congestion at different times.
The GPS data used in this study were obtained from the recorded positions and speeds of
vehicles traveling on main roads within the study area. The data were processed through a
time-series grouping approach to calculate the average vehicle speed at each time interval.
Subsequently, the TPI values were normalized to a range between 0 and 1, allowing for
meaningful comparison of congestion levels across different days and time periods.
Daily TPI tables were then constructed for the target road, and these data were used to
develop a forecasting model for predicting TPI values in the next time interval. The model
utilized historical data as independent variables to estimate the upcoming traffic conditions.
The results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively transforms raw GPS data into
an interpretable index that reflects real-world traffic conditions. Furthermore, the method
shows potential for application in decision-support systems for traffic management.

Objectives

To study and analyze road congestion using probe data, such as average speed, location, and duration of vehicle stops, in order to establish appropriate criteria for identifying congestion points and forecasting future road congestion.
